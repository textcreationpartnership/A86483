            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Way of <hi>Independencie,</hi> pretending to be the Way of God, <hi>the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Way, the onely Way</hi> (as the most rigid Separation, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm.

               <hi>H.</hi> I, as the Lord hath enabled me, have conferred with and examined ſome ſpeciall Witneſſes; they anſwer (if I underſtand them aright) that they can witneſſe no ſuch thing as they are produced for. If this be acknowledged, I have my full end: If any will reexamine them, I beſeech him not to put them on the Wrack<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Pet. 3.16.</note> nor to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with by-ſtanders or by-matters, but to minde the thing in hand. If he ſhew that their Teſtimonies are fit and full for the purpoſe, he doeth ſomething: if not (whatſoever elſe he do) he doeth nothing. I publiſh not all their Depoſition, not all that is materiall; but ſo much as I conceive at preſent ſufficient. If any of the Brethren (amongst whom M. <hi>Cotton</hi> is deſervedly the chief) ſeem in my apprehenſion to come neerer the Truth then others, I willingly take notice of it, both to honour their Ingenuity, and to help Accommodation (if it may be) between us and them. What ſtrength is in this Writing, I confeſſe it is borrowed; the weakneſſe of it is mine own, for which I have onely this Excuſe, That I am not willingly wilfull, but ſhall be ready, as God ſhall aſſist, to give or receive further Satisfaction.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtles never taught or practiſed to gather or ſeparate ſome Chriſtians from others, one part of this true Church,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> and another part of that (eſpecially perſons which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves converted not) to make a purer Church, neither with nor without the Magiſtrates Authority.

But you profeſſe not ſuch a <hi>Latitude of oppoſition againſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie;</hi> nor do you hold (I ſuppoſe) that our godly non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformable Brethren, ſuſpended by the Biſhops, or <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>-Miniſters, depoſed by their Churches (to ſay nothing of Miniſters deprived by the Parliament for Malignancie) are bound, by the Apoſtles example, to execute their Miniſtery in the Churches, notwithſtanding ſuch Suſpenſion or Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or that Maſter <hi>Ward,</hi> depoſed by the Church at <hi>Roterdam,</hi> was bound to execute his Miniſtery there, before his Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110835:3"/>Had you ſuch an immediate Commiſſion, ſealed from heaven, and ſuch infallible direction of the holy Ghoſt, as the Apoſtles had, you might more boldly imitate them therein; eſpecially if the caſe of living under a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, endeavouring, and conſulting with Divines, about the Reformation of the Church; and of living under a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Magiſtrate, and profeſſed publike enemy of the Church, were not much different.

               </argument>
               <p>The caſe of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> was extraordinary; there were no more in the world, and therefore could be no more in the Church. <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife, and firſt ſons, yea <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf was the Church, if then there was any: yet you hold not that two or three, yea one, may make a Church. <hi>Cain</hi> lawfully married his own ſiſter, May other men now do the like? Twelve are more then ſeven or eight, and an hundred and twenty a competent number; yet it appears not that they were called or counted a Church, till they were more encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

What will you make of Chriſt and his Diſciples? a Church diſtinct from the Jewiſh? <hi>You know Chriſt did not make a new Church, or gather men into it; but lived and died a member of the Jewiſh Church</hi>

It is an Argument you will not own: Seven, eight, twelve, may make a domeſticall Church, <hi>ergo,</hi> they may make a congregationall.

               </argument>
               <p>It ſeems by the words, <hi>Thou, O man of God,</hi> I give <hi>thee</hi> charge that <hi>thou</hi> keep this Commandment,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> (<hi>viz.</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately precedes) concerning faith and holineſſe, in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Word, to be directed to <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelf: or if to his ſucceſſours, then it it muſt be to the ordinary Elders (for evangeliſts which ſucceeded him we know none) not to the Churches; for example, not to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> writes nothing of Government, though in his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> he writes almoſt of nothing elſe, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth <hi>the Elders to take heed to the Flock,</hi> and look to the Wolves, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. But if you wil needs have the words, <hi>this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> extended to this whole Epiſtle, yea to every Precept and Example of Diſcipline in Gods Book, you had need of good warrant for this expoſition. That the eſſentials of Diſcipline ſet down in Scripture are unchangeable, I grant: but whether any eſſentials be in controverſie, or how many, and which they are, you tell us not: I am ſure thoſe things that ſome (poſſibly) do make eſſentiall, are not ſuch; as, holy kiſſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing with Oil, waſhing of feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Apoſtolike Churches and ours are obſervable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they juſtly occaſion ſome alteration, at leaſt in externals, of Diſcipline or Worſhip.</p>
               <p>As firſt, the Jewiſh ceremonies were then ſcarce dead, at leaſt, not buried: hence we are not bound to uſe unleavened bread at the Sacrament, to abſtain from things ſtrangled and from blood, to circumciſe, to purifie our ſelves, and to ſhave our heads, <hi>&amp;c. Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.20. &amp; 16.3. &amp; 21.21, 22, 23, 26. &amp; 23.2, 5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the civill cuſtomes of theſe countreys differ much from ours: Hence we are not bound to lie or lean on a bed at the Sacrament, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.23, 25. &amp; 21.20. to waſh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers feet, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.5, 14, 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.38. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5 10. to kiſſe one another, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.37. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.20.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110835:15"/>1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.26. or to make covering of the mans head a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of diſhonour, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.11.4.5.7.10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Churches were then but in gathering from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Heathens and Jews: Hence we want examples (to convince refractory Anabaptiſts or Socinians) of the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Chriſtian Infants, or of any other, though of riper yeers, that was born of Chriſtian parents, and educated in a Chriſtian way, and was not in perſon a Jew or an Heathen.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Church was then under Heatheniſh perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Magiſtrates: Hence they had no houſes built for, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to holy Worſhip, they met in the night to pray, preach, and celebrate the Supper; Miniſters had no ſetled maintenance; no Laws did compell men to keep the Sabbaths, to frequent the Aſſemblies, to ſubmit to the Churches Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; Chriſtians bare no civill Offices; the Magiſtrate did not meddle with, nor protect, but perſecute the Church.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, there was then an extraordinary effuſion of the holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and ſundry of the Elders and people: Hence there was no need of Univerſities nor Schools to teach Tongues and Arts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. nor of ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Sermons, nor uſing ſet Prayers or Pſalms; for by the Spirit they then compoſed both, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. no looking on Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles (Printing being not then in uſe) when the Paſtour read or preached; no writing Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Apoſtles had the care of all the Churches, and without difference taught and baptized, and ordered mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in all Churches where they came, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. &amp; 4.17. &amp; 16.1. &amp; 7.11. (to ſay nothing of the Evangeliſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets) Now we may not, without preſumptuous tempting of God, expect ſuch Officers, but muſt be contented with ordinary Elders, amongſt whom ſo much of their power as God intended to be perpetuall, is divided.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, there were then ſome extraordinary occaſionall Precepts and Practices, which binde not in ordinary; as, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all to give to the poor, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.21. having all things common, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.44.45. &amp; 4.32, 34, 35. anointing the ſick will Oil, <hi>James</hi> 5.14. which are Apiſhly imitated by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, if not by others.</p>

               <p>Finally, do but publiſh a full Narrative of your Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and practices, and eſpecially of all which you count Eſſentials, and prove them by Scripture; and I ſhall freely, by the grace of God, either conſent with you, or ſhew rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of diſſenting.</p>
